These test cases exercise the Event_Log_Visualizer in order to make sure that it
operates for all common event log entries.

The test cases are driven by run_tests.py which can be executed directly but
also has some command line options that can be accessed with '--help'.

A brief description of the test cases is given in TEST_CASE_DESCRIPTIONS.md,
also shown at the bottom of the '--help' output.
